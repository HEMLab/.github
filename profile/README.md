Initiated by Professor [Qiuhua Liang](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/abce/staff/qiuhua-liang/), **[Hydro-Environmental Modelling Labarotory](http://www.hemlab.org)**, is a rsearch team with members from different research organisations, interested in development and application of high-performance modelling and data analytics tools to support natural hazard risk assessment and management.

Working at the forefront of computational and data technologies, we develop new numerical methods and models for simulating flooding and the associated transport processes, including sediment dynamics, hydro-geomorphological change, floating debris and pollutant transport, using the latest high-performance computing technology based on graphics processing units (GPUs).

The high-performance numerical methods and models are adapted and applied to simulate other types of natural hazards, including dam-break floods, tsunamis, storm surges, flow-like landslides and debris flows.
